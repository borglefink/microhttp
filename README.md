## Description

*microhttp* is a tiny http server written in Go (http://golang.org/). 
Default hostname is localhost:80, but this can be configured by a config file.
What is served out of the box is html, css and js files, and whatever else the built-in Go http server can serve.

## Background

I just wrote this to have a very small basic web server in my Raspberry Pi B+.

## License

A MIT license is used here (almost nothing to license, though :-P ), suggestions for improvements are welcome. :-)
