## Description

*microhttp* is a small configurable http server written in Go (http://golang.org/). 
Default hostname is localhost:80, but this can be configured by a config file.

What is served out of the box is html, css and js files, and whatever else the builtin Go http server can serve.

## Background

I just wrote this to have a miniscule footprint webserver in my Raspberry Pi B+.

## License

A MIT license is used here (almost nothing to license, though), suggestions for improvements are welcome. :-)
